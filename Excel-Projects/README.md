# Sleep Disorders Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes factors influencing sleep disorders using a health dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between sleep disorders and variables such as age, gender, stress levels, and physical activity. The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables, charts, and descriptive statistics.

## Objectives
- Identify demographic and lifestyle factors associated with sleep disorders  
- Visualize trends and correlations in the dataset  
- Provide actionable insights based on the findings  

## Tools and Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel: Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Formulas  
- Data Cleaning and Preparation within Excel  
- Descriptive Statistical Analysis (mean, median, frequencies)  
- Data Visualization (bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots)  

## Data Description
The dataset contains health survey responses including:  
- Age groups  
- Gender  
- Stress level  
- Physical activity frequency  
- BMI categories  
- Sleep quality and duration  
- Presence or absence of sleep disorders  

## Analysis Steps
1. *Data Cleaning:* Checked for missing or inconsistent data and standardized categories.  
2. *Pivot Tables:* Created pivot tables to summarize data by gender, age group, and stress level.  
3. *Visualization:* Developed charts to illustrate distributions and highlight significant differences.  
4. *Cross-tabulation:* Explored relationships between sleep disorders and other variables.  
5. *Interpretation:* Drew insights and summarized key findings in a clear format.  

## Key Findings
- Females reported a higher prevalence of sleep disorders compared to males.  
- Higher stress levels were strongly correlated with increased reports of poor sleep quality.  
- The age group 30–40 had the highest incidence of sleep disorders.  
- Physical activity was linked to better sleep outcomes, with more active individuals reporting fewer disorders.  
- BMI categories showed a trend where overweight individuals had slightly more sleep problems.

## Challenges Encountered
- Dealing with some inconsistent data entries required manual cleaning.  
- Limited dataset size impacted the strength of some conclusions.  

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the demographics and lifestyle factors affecting sleep disorders. These findings can help guide targeted health interventions and further research.
