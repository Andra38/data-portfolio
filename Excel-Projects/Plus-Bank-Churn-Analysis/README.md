# Plus Bank Churn Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed churn analysis for *Plus Bank, based on a dataset of **1,000 customers* across *France, Germany, and Spain*.  
The goal of this project is to understand the characteristics of customers who left the bank and identify patterns that can help improve customer retention.

## Key Findings

### 1. Demographic Insights

- Many belonged to the *Gen X age group* (approximately ages 40–55).
- This suggests that middle-aged female customers may be at higher churn risk.

  Long-term customers leaving may signal a *decline in satisfaction over time*.
- They typically maintained *medium account balances*.
- Their *credit scores were generally average or okay*, so creditworthiness was not a primary churn factor.

---
